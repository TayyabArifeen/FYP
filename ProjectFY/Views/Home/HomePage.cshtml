                The development of e-commerce in the whole world has made it possible for economic development. E-commerce globally has grown enormously in the past twenty years with growth rates of sales standing at 13 percent, which equates to sales that were worth an estimated $2.9 trillion. These figures are expected to reach $4.5 trillion by 2021. Online shopping reached growth of 12 percent in 2017 with a worth of $1.3 billion. There have been several studies which confirm that 18 percent of all online retail sales in Pakistan took place in 2018. Forecasts show that by 2040 it is expected that 95 percent of all retail sales and purchases will be made and facilitated online.

However, purchasing from foreign sellers has recently gained traction as the share of buyers has climbed from 15-21 percent. Approximately, 25 percent of shopping worldwide is now taking place online, with China recording a colossal 440 million online consumers.
